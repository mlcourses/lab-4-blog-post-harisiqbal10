# Lab 4: Exploring Sensor Integration

## Overview and Motivation
The purpose of this lab exercise is to explore ways the Arduino, an embedded computer system, can communicate and interact with the external environment. We introduce two sensors (devices which gather information from the external environment for the Arduino), and two actuators (a device through which the Arduino affects physical change in the external environment). We chose to design a Distance Detector as our project design. To design this project of the Distance Detector, we are to build a handheld proximity detector that emits a sound whose pitch correlates with the distance to a nearby object.
